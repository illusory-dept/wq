(1) fn
    to call functions that accept 0 args, do:
        fn[;]
    to call functions that accept 1 arg, do one of the following:
        fn 1        // recommended
        fn[1;]      // the trailing ; is required
    the following is invalid:
        fn -1       // this is currently parsed as (- fn 1)
                    // to pass -1 to fn, do: fn(-1) or fn[-1;]
    to call functions that accept >=2 args:
        fn[1;2;]
    functions defined without a param list can be called with 0, 1 or 2 args,
    which are implicitly bound to x and y.
    to explicitly define a function that accepts 0 args, do one of th following:
        fn:{[]...}
        fn:{[;]...}

(2) body
    currently, "blocks" are not present in wq,
    therefore the following is invalid:
        $[true;{do1;do2};do3]   // INVALID

    instead, do the following:
        c:do0
        $[c;do1;do2;;]
        $[not c;;do1;do2]       // which acts as if-else

    loops accept an arbitrary number of bodies:
        N[3;echo n;a:n+1;echo a;]

    if you really need "blocks" for some reason, do one of following:
        {do1;do2;do3}()         // invokes an
        {do1;do2;do3}[;]        // anonymous function.

(3) scoping
    currently, assignments inside function bodies create new bindings,
    overshadowing any bindings with the same name in the outer scope.
    as a result, you cannot modify a variable from the outer scope within a function body.

(4) interpreter
    currently, the interpreter reads scripts line by line.
    as a result, you cannot split a function body across multiple lines:
        fn:{[n]
            echo n}             // INVALID
    instead, function bodies must be written as a single line.

(5) echo
    when given a string (i.e., a list of chars), echo prints it without quotes.
    to print a single char without quotes, do:
        echo(,"a")

(6) semicolons
    function calls require a semicolon at the end of the arg list,
    whereas indexing requires that there is no trailing semicolon. e.g.,
        fn[1;2;]
        lst[1;2]
        dic[`a;`b]
    in function parameter lists, a trailing semicolon is optional.
    both of the following are valid:
        fn:{[m;n]...}
        fn:{[m;n;]...}
