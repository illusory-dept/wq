(1) fn
    the following is invalid as a call:
        fn -1       // this is currently parsed as (- fn 1)
                    // to pass -1 to fn: fn(-1) or fn[-1]
    functions defined without a param list can be called with 0, 1, 2 or 3 args,
    which are implicitly bound to x, y and z.
    to explicitly define a function that accepts 0 args:
        fn:{[]...}

(2) newlines
    newlines are generally accepted and can act as semicolons in most contexts.

    valid examples:
        lst: (1
              2
              3)
        f: {[a;b;c;d;e;f
             g;h;i;j;]
            echo x
            echo y}

    "important positions":
        some positions are considered "important", and a semicolon is explicitly required.
            $[true;      // important
                1;         // important
                2]
            N[3;         // important
                echo n]
